<h3 id="story">Story <a class="direct-link" href="#story">#</a></h3>
<p>The other night a group I've joined at times was reading through the Bible. I have participated in such groups in the past. This group feels and functions very similarly to the others. It begins with small talk with beverages. Then an opening prayer to kick things off followed by scripture reading and discussion. Prayer requests and a time of prayer follows after which small talk resumes.</p>
<p>This group is reading through the gospel of Mark. This night was looking at chapter 7. It begins with Jesus and his disciples eating with unwashed hands. The religious elite of the day saw this a major failure and questioned Jesus about it. Just let them have it teaching the defilement to be most concerned about is what comes from within us.</p>
<p>The group commented on the story, sharing as you might expect, such as the culture of the day and the failure of the religious to miss the forest for the trees, but never venturing into asking questions of ourselves. What do we hold to which we are concerned defiled ignoring what is within us? Do we give, bestow, are blessings onto others outside our circle? Is anyone begging something of us? Why not? Do we give even what we have?</p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection <a class="direct-link" href="#reflection">#</a></h3>
<p>My sense is we are proud of ourselves. That we are beyond those we rail about. Or beyond those other Christian groups. But are we really? It feels are the same thing in a different way. Even though there are great variances in Christian groups we are all formulaic and we use to hold to them. I suppose it's natural, only human. But I wonder how closely we compare to those we think ourselves better than. Wash you hands feel like read scripture, discuss, pray. But the question of defilement was missed. The question of ourselves was missed. We are those we think we're better than. Anger rises within me. But I also have hope.</p>
<h3 id="proposal">Proposal <a class="direct-link" href="#proposal">#</a></h3>
<p>I hope when we realize this it leads us to real empathy. Forgiveness comes more easily when we see how the gap between us has been bridged. Instead of further division it brings unity. The differences between us, between groups, are real but that doesn't mean divisions are the result. And I found that as I was sitting there in that group I felt superior to them because they weren't reflecting on themselves and thinking themselves superior to those in the story. Sounds like the exact same thing I was doing to them. On realization of this the gap I had created between us had been bridged. I</p>
