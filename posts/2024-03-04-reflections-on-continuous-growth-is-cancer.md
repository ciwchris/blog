This morning I read the article [Continuous growth is cancer](https://christianheilmann.com/2023/03/03/continuous-growth-is-cancer/).

Several aspects of this post resonated with me. I recognize cycles of growth are important and
necessary. But it seems to me growth is our primary objective. It makes sense. It's an easy metric
which shows we are succeeding, at least at first look and for the moment. Perhaps it provides
positive emotions, because the pursuit of growth triggers dopamine. But growth cannot continue
continuously forever. The pursuit of growth is often shortsighted which can lead to detrimental
consequences. Cancer in someways in an apt analogy.

I've been at my current organization as it has more than doubled in size. They have managed growth
well. Be there are aspects of who we were which have been lost, which I mourn. It's not the same
place. I'm grateful for what the organization has provided me. But I'm also discouraged, saddened
and frustrated. The organization believes growth is always necessary and always what we should be
pursuing. It supports you in your career, as long as your career is moving up the management ladder,
which I am not interested in. Even though I have done much of the leading which has brought my
department to where we currently are I am left unrecognized as others pass me by on their pursuit of
"leadership". When I inquire about other forms of leadership the only response I receive is sorry,
we're not big enough to support other forms of leadership.

I am left feeling we get our priorities out of wack. Others have been sounding the trumpet about the
shortsightedness of our culture today. What is the solution to this? Is there a different value
which can guide us? If so what risk and impact must be accepted to follow it? Are we too big to
change?
