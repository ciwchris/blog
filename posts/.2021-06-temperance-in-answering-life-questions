> I began this letter by observing that you'll soon discover one of the most demanding questions you'll be asked is "What do you want?" That question seems straightforward, like one we ought to be able to answer without a great deal of reflection. but you'll find that it's a very challenging question, because it isn't at all clear that most of us know what we really want. As a result, we often mischaracterize it, and the result is a misshapen life. Temperance is the virtue that gives us the time to discover what we want when our desires are rightly formed.

> I began this letter by calling attention to our very different stages in life. I did so to suggest that you'll soon find yourself confronted by the question "What do you want?" Even more demanding will be the question "What do you wan to get out of life?" Temperance means you don't have to answer those questions before you're ready.

> I've been doing this little exercise for the last couple of weeks where I start each day with a blank sheet of paper and I write at the top of it, "What do I really want?" And it's surprising how useful it can be to ask yourself the same question again and again. You would think it would just get repetitive and boring and it's not useful anymore, but actually doing it each day, your answers change a little bit, they get more precise, things that you thought we really wanted turned out to just be a middle step and you can skip them entirely. And the better of an answer you have to that question, what am I optimizing for? What do I really want? The better your strategy becomes because you cut out a lot of wasted effort and energy.

> Mostly about choosing what you want to optimize for. And the type of identity that you want to reinforce the type of person you want to become and then building habits creating a system that is organized toward that outcome. And so again, I think the first question is like, who do I want to become, you know? So, one of my optimizing for. And so, I often start with what I call identity-based Habits, where you kind of start with, what is the identity, I want to reinforce who is the type of person I want to become, who's the kind of person that could Can achieve the outcome that I want. That's another way to get to that question because a lot of people the idea of like a trying to choose your identity or trying to pick your values or principles. It's kind of like a really big picture thing and sometimes it's hard to have a good answer to that but most people know the result they want, they know that they want to get six pack abs where they want to double their income or whatever. And so you can say, "Okay, fine, who is the type of person that could have six pack abs?" And maybe you realize, "Oh, it's the type of person who doesn't miss workouts." And so now you're focused more on building habits that are aligned with that identity and that could get you to do something like, "Do one pushup."
