<h3 id="the-desire">The desire <a class="direct-link" href="#the-desire">#</a></h3>
<p>Recently I read a question by someone asking how to become a better storyteller. This question<br>
resonates with me. I feel I lack the ability to tell a good story. I'm not sure where the desire to<br>
be a good storyteller comes from. The place I first identify is to be warmer and more entertaining in<br>
social situations. But I don't know if the desire is to be looked well upon, to soothe my own social<br>
anxiety, for the benefit of the other, to create a better community, or some other reason.</p>
<h3 id="the-recommendation">The recommendation <a class="direct-link" href="#the-recommendation">#</a></h3>
<p>The questioner received several answers. The book <a href="https://store.storygrid.com/books/">Story Grid</a>, along with its associated material.<br>
<a href="https://channel101.fandom.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit">Dan Harmon's story structure</a> was also recommended. I read through the structure. It provided a<br>
good framing for me. It will require practice for me to place stories I tell into this format. But<br>
having a structure provides me confidence in being able to craft a story.</p>
<p>But of course I need a source for stories I tell. The best way to generate stories is to live a life<br>
full of stories. As an introvert my experiences are minimal and not very exciting, so I don't feel<br>
like I have a plentiful source.</p>
<h3 id="everyday-is-a-story">Everyday is a story <a class="direct-link" href="#everyday-is-a-story">#</a></h3>
<p>Stories, however, I don't think need to be as exciting as what I feel they need to be. Yes, if<br>
something eventful happens the story is more engaging. But we relate to lots of things which happen<br>
in life. Additionally, I can be creative with my stories. I can make up things which happen,<br>
similar to jokes. Or start from something I observe. Or start from something which happens but then<br>
continue forward in a creative way, how it played out in my head. All of these sources can be<br>
entertaining and communicate about my perspective, the way I see things, think about things.<br>
Therefore being creative doesn't mean it's empty sharing. The story still contains meaning. It's<br>
communicating a different aspect.</p>
<h3 id="the-stories-we-tell-ourselves">The stories we tell ourselves <a class="direct-link" href="#the-stories-we-tell-ourselves">#</a></h3>
<p>This morning I felt sleepy as I was sitting during church. As we were walking to the car afterwards<br>
my wife asked if I was tired. I said I was resting as I was listening. She said I was head bobbing<br>
during church.</p>
<p>As we drove away I felt embarrassed and wondering who else noticed. Along with this feeling I<br>
started thinking why I was sleepy. I began having conversations with others in my head telling them<br>
why I was sleepy and so why it was reasonable I was head bobbing.</p>
<p>It was at this moment I realized I was telling myself a story. I've learned we are constantly telling<br>
ourselves stories. This was a good example on how this plays out in life. It reminds me of the study<br>
in which the corpus callosum was severed in people who experience seizures in order to prevent<br>
seizures from occurring. An interesting result was found which has been named the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-brain_interpreter">left-brain<br>
interpreter</a>. When the field of vision is restricted between the left and right eyes then if the<br>
right eye is shown something the left brain will make up what it believes to be a reasonable<br>
explanation about the action which occurred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the left-brain interpreter will nonetheless construct a contrived explanation for the action,<br>
unaware of the instruction the right brain had received.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been determined we all experience this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The drive to seek explanations and provide interpretations is a general human trait, and the<br>
left-brain interpreter can be seen as the glue that attempts to hold the story together, in order<br>
to provide a sense of coherence to the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was then I realized that I am already an expert storyteller. My brain is constantly telling<br>
myself stories. Believable stories. I am a storyteller. It's not a foreign practice. Therefore<br>
relax, trust your instincts and dive in!</p>
